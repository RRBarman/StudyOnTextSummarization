# Study on Text Summarization Using Text Similarity & Increasing Precision Of Textual Similarity Score
We aim for a generic model, that requires no prior knowledge of natural language (such as parse trees) and no external resources of structured semantic information. From word-level to short-text-level semantics by combining insights from methods based on external sources of semantic knowledge with word embeddings and increasing the precision of similarity(gloss score) score to attain more precise HumanSensed Text.
